# ML-Models
Ml models include SVR,RF,LR,GBM
SVR (Support Vector Regression):

Uses Support Vector Machines to model complex relationships in data, particularly effective with non-linear patterns.
LR (Linear Regression):

Simple and interpretable method assuming a linear relationship between features and the target variable.
RF (Random Forest):

Ensemble learning technique combining multiple decision trees to provide robust predictions and resist overfitting.
GBM (Gradient Boosting Machine):

Sequentially builds weak learners, correcting errors made by previous models to create a powerful predictive model.
